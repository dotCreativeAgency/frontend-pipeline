# ⚠️ This Repository Has Been Consolidated

**The `frontend-pipeline` plugin is now part of the [dotCreativeAgency/claude-plugins](https://github.com/dotCreativeAgency/claude-plugins) marketplace monorepo.**

## New Location

📍 **Plugin location**: [`plugins/frontend-pipeline/`](https://github.com/dotCreativeAgency/claude-plugins/tree/master/plugins/frontend-pipeline)

## Installation

Install the plugin from the marketplace:

```bash
# Add the marketplace
/plugin marketplace add dotCreativeAgency/claude-plugins

# Install the plugin
/plugin install frontend-pipeline@dotcreativeagency-plugins
```

## Why This Change?

The plugin has been moved into a monorepo structure to:
- Simplify maintenance (single repository instead of two)
- Enable atomic cross-plugin changes
- Centralize CI/CD pipeline
- Reduce management overhead
